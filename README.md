# The Third Kind


Hello there! We are [Rihab Hoceini](https://github.com/HoceiniRihab), [Rishi Koushik T](https://github.com/RishiKoushik) and [Mohammad Zuhair Khan](https://github.com/MZuhairKhan), and this is our submission to the Quantum Creative Winter Fest 2023.

We have created a "quantum creative" story based on a space exploration theme. This is followed by a few quantum computing challenges for our adventurous readers! Solve the challenges to complete the story!

# How can I take part?

We'll start from the story. You can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10f61rDcQjPWBnqBu-ymz8QQXy9yvjki-Kk9CECB9kqI/edit?usp=sharing) or from <b>The Third Kind.pdf</b> in this repository. We recommend the first option!

Next, check out the challenges in our Jupyter Notebook from <b>The_Third_Kind.ipynb</b> in this repository.

P.S. Stuck? You can check how we did it [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PD1N7WQFhTS0uf_n_6IIrsxqwz0qz3Vt?usp=sharing). However, it is a lot more fun if you finish all the challenges and then compare your answers to our answers!

And if you get through all the challenges, we have a special surprise for you!
